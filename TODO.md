# 🐞 zmk-nice!beetle TODO

A living and ever expanding list of improvements and ideas to improve Beedly.

---

## ✅ Core Tasks

- [X] Add Python-based workflow to automatically convert `.png` images into LVGL-compatible `.c` arrays  
  - [X] Integrate with a `Makefile`
  - [X] Output to same folder with `.gitignore` support
  - [X] Add requirements file for Python dependencies
- [X] Port the widgets to LVGL 9 / ZMK `main` (Zephyr 4.1)
  - [X] `make beedly` writes the firmware frame file (`beedly_frames.c`) directly, no copy-paste
- [ ] Verify the LVGL 9 port on hardware (layout, rotation, Luna animations, inverted colours)

## 🌠 Stretch Goals

- [ ] Replace current heart animation with an energy-style indicator  
  - [ ] Tie energy level to ZMK's shield battery percentage
  - [ ] Adjust animation speed or brightness based on charge level

- [ ] Add interactive Tamagotchi-like behavior to Beedly  
  - [ ] Track typing activity to simulate "feeding"
  - [ ] Idle timer to trigger "boredom" or "sleep"
  - [ ] Basic mood states (happy, hungry, tired, annoyed)
  - [ ] Optional: store "stats" in persistent memory or host-only flash

- [ ] Beedly to replace Luna animations on LHS peripheral.
